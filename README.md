## For Developers

If you are interested in helping us develop the application, please make sure you have
the following installed on your development machine first:

- Java 8
- Gradle 4.0
- Tomcat 8

On the command line, execute the command `gradle eclipse` to download and install all
the libraries required to develop the application. The command will also generate the
`.classpath` and `.project` files so you will be able to import the application as an
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) project.
